Comparison of different neural network learning algorithms for Intrusion Detection System
Intrusion detection system(IDS) is a key element of any cyber security
system. It alerts the system about any malicious packet which may try to
intrude or attack the system. IDS systems exist in various forms -
anomaly-based , signature-based and misuse-based IDS. Given the volume of
ever increasing data coupled with variety and velocity over a complex web
of networks ,it is pertinent to save the sensitive information and
preserve the privacy of the data. There is an urgent need for a very fast
and self learning IDS so that the user or organisations are secure and do
not have to engage in dealing with the attacks on the system. In this
study, we compare different neural network learning algorithms and
propose a model for IDS. The different neural network learning algorithms
used are:
Backpropagation, Resilient Backpropagation, Smallest Absolute Gradient
and Smallest Learning Rate.
In my work, performance of different algorithms have been studied and
evaluated on the NSL-KDD dataset.
